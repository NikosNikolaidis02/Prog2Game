"This is my destiny... a day the gods will remember." 
Zeus heard this phrase from you, when he saw you in front of him.
It all started when young Zeus decided to visit the Land of Mortals. There, in one of his wanderings, he met beautiful Java. Astonished by her beauty, he did not resist to approach her. She fell in love with him at first sight and soon learned that they were expecting a son. Unfortunately, according to an old prophecy, the first child that Zeus would have with a mortal, would surpass his father in power and overthrow him. Fearing that this child would seize his throne, he ordered the death of both.
At the hearing of this order, the pregnant Java escaped from Zeus and hid away from him. After 18 years, Java confessed the truth to her son about his father. Knowing about the prophecy and on the occasion of the hatred that possessed him, he began his journey to conquer Olympus.
