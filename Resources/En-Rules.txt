The aim of the game is for the player to conquer Olympus. He can 
achieve this by defeating his respective god-opponent in each round.

Each player and each God has 4 characteristics:
1) Health Power: The state in which the player finds himself after each hit of the opponent.
2) Attack: The player's ability to attack the opponent.
3) Armor: The player's ability to defend himself in the opponent's attack, in other words how resistant he is against the hits.
4) Energy: The energy of the player in the particular round, which varies depending on the move he chooses.

After the end of each round and if the player has won, he has at his disposal some points that he can distribute to his 
3 characteristics(Health Power, Attack, Armour) as he wishes.
The available upgrade points are given in proportion to the Health Power of the player who survived the battle.

The player has 5 moves at his disposal:
2 attack moves the Sword (the strongest) and the Spear.
The Shield move is a defensive move.
The Meditate move multiplies the defense and attack stats.
The player also has the option of No Move where nothing happens.
The movements of the gods are in full correspondence.

Rounds 6 (God: Apollo) and 12 (God: Zeus) are considered checkpoints.
Therefore, if the player loses after these rounds, he does not start the game from the
beginning but returns to the last checkpoint, but he has this possibility only once.
